# PyPlumes
A workspace for a plume particle model in Python. <br />
Translated and modified from [this model](https://github.com/Veyza/dudi) originally written in Fortran. 

Run the testing/enceladus_test.py file for an example output with real data from Cassini flyby. It might take a while. A model for dust number density on Enceladus will be created and a plot comparing that with the real HRD observation during the Cassini flyby will be shown.
